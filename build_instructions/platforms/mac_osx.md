## OS X Mavericks

The Mac platform installation is managed the extensive usage of "HomeBrew". This package provides many Max OS X builds and installations required for Nalu.

### Homebrew

Download and Install [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Installation) on your local home terminal:

Now you can install homebrew; "brew doctor" will be the first line comamnd required.

	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
	brew doctor
	
###Packages to be obtained from homebrew 

#####OpenMpi
	brew install openmpi
	
####Cmake	
	brew search cmake  //cmake is there and will pop up on the next line
	brew install cmake

#### libxml2
	brew search libxml2
	brew install libxml2


#### boost
	brew install boost
	brew tap homebrew/science
	brew search superlu	
	brew install superlu 
	
Once done with the boost install, make sure everybody can read the files:

	sudo chmod -R u+rwX,go+rX,go-w /usr/local/Cellar


###Non-Homebrew
Other Nalu required libraries must be managed outside of the homebrew environment

## Helpful notes
How to specify install location and compilers with `configure` and `cmake`
  
When building packages that use configure, do a
  
	./configure PREFIX=/usr/local/pachages/install CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx

When building packages that use cmake, do a `mkdir build; cd build` then

	cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx -DCMAKE_CC_COMPILER=mpicc -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/myPath/install ..`

For all non-HomeBrew packages, myPath above will be /usr/local/packages

	mkdir /usr/local/packages
	mkdir /usr/local/packages/install

####yaml-cpp, 0.3.0

Yaml is provided by [code.google.com](https://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/downloads/detail?name=yaml-cpp-0.3.0.tar.gz&can=2&q=)

Follow the yaml installation directions. This process will put the created files in /user/local/include/yaml-cpp. Below are some high level points:

	mkdir /usr/local/packages
	cd packages/
	curl -o yaml-cpp-0.3.0.tar.gz https://yaml-cpp.googlecode.com/files/yaml-cpp-0.3.0.tar.gz 
	tar -zxvf yaml-cpp-0.3.0.tar.gz 
	mv yaml-cpp yaml-cpp-0.3.0

This series of commands will create `/usr/local/packages/yaml-cpp-0.3.0`

Next, build yaml-cpp

	cd /usr/local/packages/yaml-cpp-0.3.0
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx -DCMAKE_CC_COMPILER=mpicc -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local/packages/install ..
	make
	make install

#### zlib, 1.2.8

zlib is provided by the [zlib](http://www.zlib.net) project.
	
	cd /usr/local/packages/
	curl -o zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
	tar -zxvf zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz 

Build zlib

	cd /usr/local/packages/zlib-1.2.8
	CC=gcc CXX=g++ CFLAGS=-O3 CXXFLAGS=-O3 ./configure --archs="-arch x86_64" --prefix=/usr/local/packages/install/
	make
	make install

#### hdf5, 1.8.12

hdf5 1.8.12 is provided by the [HDF](http://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/index.html) group

	cd /usr/local/packages/
	curl -o hdf5-1.8.12.tar.gz http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.8.12/src/hdf5-1.8.12.tar.gz
	tar -zxvf hdf5-1.8.12.tar.gz 
	
This series of commands will create `/usr/local/packages/hdf5-1.8.12`

Build

	cd /usr/local/packages/hdf5-1.8.12
	./configure CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 CXX=mpicxx CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -O3" CFLAGS="-fPIC -O3" FCFLAGS="-fPIC -O3" --enable-parallel --with-zlib=/usr/local/packages/install --prefix=/usr/local/packages/install
	make
	make install
	make check

#### netcdf 4.3.1

netcdf is provided on [github](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/releases)
 
Scroll down until you see "NetCDF-C 4.3.1.1 (Bugfix Release)" or similar
Click on the "Source (tar.gz)" button to download and then move the tar file to: `/usr/local/packages`

	cd /usr/local/packages
	tar -xvf netcdf-c-4.3.1.1.tar

This process will create `/usr/local/packages/netcdf-c-4.3.1.1`

Build

	cd /usr/local/packages/netcdf-c-4.3.1.1
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local/packages/install CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 CXX=mpicxx CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/packages/install/include -O3" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/packages/install/lib" --disable-fsync --disable-cdmremote --disable-dap --disable-shared --disable-doxygen
	make
	make install
	make check

#### Trilinos

Trilinos is managed by the [Trilinos](http://www.trilinos.org) project and can be found on github.

Clone the latest version of Trilinos within `/packages`:

	cd /usr/local/packages/
	git clone https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos.git

In some cases, the master Trilinos code base may have build issues. This is a rare occurance, however, some aspects to Trilinos that Nalu require, e.g., Tpetra, kokkos, STK and Muelu are in `active` development. If problems arise, one can revert back to a possible successful SHA-1 using bisect. Again, this is hopefully going to be mitigated by the strong SQA efforts at SNL.

##### Nalu Releases

Unfortunately, github does not allow for a "live" wiki for each of the existing branches of Nalu.wiki. As such, instructions for the particular releases have been embedded within this head wiki file.

###### Release v1.0.0-release

For the formal v1.0.0-release, checkout the following Trilinos Version:

        git checkout trilinos-release-12-0-branch		

This version is the expected Trilinos code base for the v1.0.0-release Nalu code base.

##### Build

Create new folder in Trilinos called build,
	
	cd /usr/local/packages/Trilinos
	mkdir build
	
Place into build the script one of the `do-configTrilinos_*` files.

`do-configTrilinos_*` will be used to run cmake to build trilinos correctly for Nalu. Note that there are two files:
one for `release` and the other `debug`. The files can be found on the Nalu GitHub site â€‹here or copied from `$nalu_build_dir/packages/Nalu/build`, which is created in the Nalu build step documented below. For example:

Pull latest version of do-configTrilinos_* from Nalu's GitHub site:

	curl -o $nalu_build_dir/packages/Trilinos/build/do-configTrilinos_release https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spdomin/Nalu/master/build/do-configTrilinos_release

or if you create the Nalu directory as directed below, simply copy one of the `do-configTrilinos_*` files from local 
copy of Nalu's git repository:

	cp $nalu_build_dir/packages/Nalu/build/do-configTrilinos_release $nalu_build_dir/packages/Trilinos/build
	
Now edit the do-configTrilinos_release to modify the defined paths as follows:

	mpi_base_dir=/usr/local/Cellar/open-mpi/1.8.3
	nalu_build_dir=/usr/local/packages
	
Next, note that some packages, i.e., boost and superLu were provided by HomeBrew. As such, make sure that boost_dir and super_lu point to `/usr/local/Cellar`

Build

	cd /usr/local/packages/Trilinos/build
	./do-configTrilinos_release
	make 
	make install

#### Nalu, the guest of honor

Nalu is provided by [github](https://github.com/spdomin/Nalu)

No doubt, you already have cloned Nalu. If not, execute the following command in the location that you want Nalu:

	git clone https://github.com/spdomin/Nalu.git
	
In `Nalu/build`, you will find the [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/spdomin/Nalu/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) and
[do-configNalu_release](https://github.com/spdomin/Nalu/blob/master/build/do-configNalu_release).

Again, note that there is a debug version as well. Copy the do-configNalu_release to a new, non-tracked file,

	cp do-configNalu_release do-configNaluNonTracked
	
Edit the paths at the top of the files by defining the `nalu_build_dir variable` as:
	
	nalu_build_dir=/usr/local/packages

within `Nalu/build`, execute the following commands

	./do-configNaluNonTracked
	make 

This process will create `naluX` within the `Nalu/build` location. Setting the DEBUG CMake option will create
a naluXd executable.

Other useful tools from, e.g., seacas, are under `/usr/local/packages/install/trilinos/bin`

#### Testing

After the `naluX` executable is created, please proceed with regression testing to ensure a proper build.

Instructions for the regression testing can be found under the [NaluRtest](https://github.com/spdomin/NaluRtest) directory.
